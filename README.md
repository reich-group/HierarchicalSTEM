# HierarchicalSTEM
Code for MCMC, simulation, and figures for spatial Bayesian hierarchical model accounting for measurement error in Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope (STEM) Images as described in the 2019 article "Accounting for Location Measurement Error in Atomic Resolution Images of Crystalline Materials".

## File Descriptions
* AtomInfo.RData - PMN STEM Image data
* DataAnalysis.R - Runs MCMC on real data using 3 models (Spatial Bayesian Hierarchical Measurement Error Model, Spatial Linear Regression, and Simple Linear Regression)
* MCMC.R - MCMC for Spatial Bayesian Hierarchical Measurement Error Model
* SimStudy.R - Runs simulation study, breaking up simulations among multiple CPU's
* boxes_ancillary_functions.R - Ancillary functions used throughout other scripts, including atom column finder and MCMC's for standard models
* Figures/
  * COM_fig.R - creates diagram of A-sites, B-sites and unweighted and weighted B-site means (Figure 2 in Paper)
  * Density_Overlay.R - Creates overlaid posterior densities (Figure 3)
  * Posterior_Ellipses.R - Creates 95% posterior ellipses on subset of image (Figure 4)
  * Rect_Figures.R - Draws rectangles around atom columns and plots estimated atom column locations (Bottom Right of Figure 1)
